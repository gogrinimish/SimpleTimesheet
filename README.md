- **No account required**: Works entirely offline
- **Open source**: Full transparency into how your data is handled

## Feedback & Bugs

Found a bug or have a suggestion? Please open an [issue](https://github.com/gogrinimish/SimpleTimesheet/issues). We use issues for:

- **Bug reports** – describe the problem, steps to reproduce, and your environment (OS, app version).
- **Feature requests** – describe the feature and how you’d use it.
- **General feedback** – ideas, UX improvements, or documentation fixes.

Check [existing issues](https://github.com/gogrinimish/SimpleTimesheet/issues) first to avoid duplicates.

## Collaborators Wanted

SimpleTimesheet is a solo project today. If you’d like to help shape the next set of features, we’re especially interested in collaborators for:

- **Android & Windows apps** – Extend the app to Android (e.g. via [Skip](https://skip.dev)) and Windows (e.g. Swift on Windows or a separate stack). Experience with cross-platform or native mobile/desktop is a plus.
- **Multiple projects / timesheets** – Design and implement support for multiple projects or timesheet “workspaces” (e.g. per client, per contract) with clear data model and UI.

If you’re interested, open an issue with the label `collaborator` or `good first project`, or comment on the relevant [roadmap issues](https://github.com/gogrinimish/SimpleTimesheet/issues).
